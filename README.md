# SCDF MyWellness

During my stint as a platoon commander, I found that many Recruits found it difficult to approach Sargeants and Officers for information or help and to combat this,
I used generative AI (OpenAI GPT 3.5) to understand a wide variety of user requests and used prompt engineering to tailor the responses to answer effectively and to 
prevent any violation of the SCDF Official Secrets Act. 

I implemented the system on telegram, a vastly popular social media plaform amongst the youth and over 6 months, the bot gained over 300 users and 500 queries.
